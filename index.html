					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>
					Hi! My name is Luc Tourangeau. I am an aspiring software developer with a background
					in just about everything.
					</p>
					<p>
					I earned my BS in Physics from Pennsylvania State University in 2019. Immediately
					after graduation, I began to work in academia as a research-assistant / programmer in
					a <a href="https://taylorlab.web.unc.edu/">quantitative biology lab</a> at UNC Chapel
					Hill until the Fall of 2022. My lab studied sea turtle navigation and how by merely
					sensing Earth's magnetic field, turtle's can return to the exact beach they were born on - 
					a fascinating ability called
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetoreception">magnetoreception</a>.
					Magnetoreception is exhibited in many different animals and most likely varies in
					mechanism depending on the species involved. In the case of sea turtles, my lab wished
					to elucidate the "how" they do it by implementing navigational algorithms in both
					simulations and robots. In the case of the latter, it was my job to design a robot
					platform that could be easily programmed by a user whom wishes to test their
					navigational algorithm.
					</p>
